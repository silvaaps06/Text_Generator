 Chorus: 50 Cent
 It''s easy to see when you look at me
 If you look closely, 50 don''t BACK DOWN
 Everywhere I go both coasts wit toast
 Eastside, Westside, I hold that MACK DOWN
 Every little nigga you see around me
 Hold a gun big enough to fuckin hold SHAQ DOWN
 Next time you in the hood and see an ol G
 You ask about me, the young boy don''t BACK DOWN
 Any living thing that cannot co exist with the kid
 Must decease existin, little nigga, now listen
 Yo mami, yo papi, that bitch you chasin
  Ya little dirty ass kids, I''ll fuckin erase them
  Your success is not enough, you wanna be hard
  Knowin that, you get knocked, you get fucked in the yard
  Youza poptart sweetheart, you soft in the middle
  I eatcha for breakfast, the watch was an exchange for your necklace
  and your boss is a bitch, if he could he would
  Sell his soul for cheap, trade his Knight to be Suge
  You can buy cars but you can''t buy respect in the hood
  Maybe I''m so disrespectfu cuz to me you''re a mystery
  I know niggaz from ya hood, you have no history
  Never sold nothin, never popped nothin, nigga stop frontin
  Jay put you on, X made you hot

  I''m back in the game shawty, to Rule and conquer
  You sing for hoes and sound like the cookie monster
  I''m the hardest from New York, my flow is bonkers
  All the other hard niggaz, they come from Yonkers
  It''s been years and you had the same niggaz in the background
  You never gonna sell unless Cadd Tah''s crack child
  Them niggaz they just SUCK, they no good
  I ain''t never heard a nigga say &quot;they like them in the hood&quot;
  I''m back better than ever, on top of my game
  Even them country boys sayin &quot;50 we feelin you mayn&quot;
  Now you stay the fuck outta my zone, outta my throne
  I''m New York City''s own...BAD GUY (BAD GUY)
  [Chorus]
  I ain''t tellin anyone you pussy

I get little (?) mad cause I''m flossin'' bad
I ain''t a wrestler, but I''ll put your bitch the Boston crab
I talk money cause it costs to brag
Round here bitches walk round here at the horse''s head (?)
Rap it get your face stuck on them bricks
I don''t really like to exercise but I''ll push up on a bitch
Y''all sweet like 99 bananas
That''s why I got 99 niggaz wit 99 hammers
They all want a nigga to stop
Cause I rap slick enough to slip the ring off of Vivica Fox
I''m just a playa that found out where the cokes know
That''s why I''mma be around longer than the Oprah show
You and your man y''all both should know
That all it takes is a finger to send you where the ghosts go
Shit I been hated since the 5th grade
that''s why my best friend the tray pound, a ice pick, and a switch blade
[Chorus]
I don''t like you, you don''t like me
Its not likely that we''ll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, Banks'' back at it again)
I don''t like you, you don''t like me
Its not likely that we''ll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, Tony''s back at it again)
[Tony Yayo]
Rule number one pick a target and study him for weeks
See where they rest at and lay with their peeps
Now you got the drop, know their daily routine
So the 2nd rule please leave the crime scene please
3rd rule pick a day, 4th rule pick a time
5th rule pick a fifth, 6th rule pick a nine
And the seventh rule make sure your sidearm sweet
So when the shootout you leave him 6 feet deep
8th meet in a fast car with disguise
Use a ski mask with shades on your eyes
9th rule don''t say shit cause Po Po listen
Fuck around you end up being stuck in the system
And the 10th rule don''t put a tag on a broken heart
Just put a toe tag on your mark
And rule number 11, you caught a body but you not a legend
You better watch where you heading

[Chorus]
I don''t like you, you don''t like   me
Its not likely that we''ll ever be   friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50''s back at it   again)
I don''t like you, you don''t like   me
Its not likely that we''ll ever be   friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50''s back at it   again)

Go ahead go against me I''ll hurt your feelings
Stones in my cross the size of your earrings
My confidence level''s high nigga can''t tell
Licking my lips (?) like I''m ill, ill
I smile like a nigga in jail receiving mail
Better yet like nigga Bookers that made bail
From day one I came in the game they said I was hot
  They got scared, & 147;Cent got money& 148;, and I got shot
  You so much pressure on me when you compare me to Pac
  I''m just a new kid, I can''t help that I''m hot
  What little niggaz say to 50 cent don''t matter
  I''ll fire shots at the ship and watch the seas scatter
  my enemies never turn into friends, my friends turn into enemies
  you scared then get the fuck around me
  Record execs, no not the (?) on my check
  I come through with my knife cause I''m a pain your neck (YEAH!)
  [Chorus]
  I don''t like you, you don''t like   me
  Its not likely that we''ll ever be   friends
  Why pretend? (Ma, 50''s back at it   again)
  I don''t like you, you don''t like   me
  Its not likely that we''ll ever be   friends
  Why pretend? (Ma, 50''s back at it   again)

BANKS VICTORY
[50 Cent]
  Yo, yo we can''t stay alive forever
  So if shit hit the fan then we might as well die together
  I''m high as ever, more holes and more cheddar
  G Unit move around wit them pounds and berreta''s
  Yea faggot, if I want it I''m gon'' have it
  Regardless if it''s handed to me or I gotta grab it
  Don''t make a ass outta yaself tryin to stop me
  I''m cocky, raps rocky, nigga you sloppy
  You know that I''m, 8 levels above you nigga
  I''ll club you nigga, I never heard of you nigga, ugly nigga
  I''m the wrong one to provoke
  You rattin on niggas is only gon'' leave you smoke
  So the only thing left now is tools for these cowrads
  I got no friends, fuck most of these cowards
  They pop shit ''till we start approaching these cowards
  While we lay around dollars, they lay around flowers
  [Lloyd Banks]
  I got a intergangstress who argue and steams wit reefer
  And who flip when I call a bitch like she Queen Latifah
  Not all the vehicle''s is long enough to stash the streetsweeper
  This shit can get uglier than the Master P sneaker
  We slidin through the ruckus, wit prada on the chuckus
  Soon as spring break ho''s home from college wanna fuck us
  I ain''t here to drop knowledge on you suckas
  I''ll sick rottweiler''s on you fuckas, cops followin to cuff us
  Top dollars to discuss this, whole lotta zeros
  When it comes to paper I blow a soul outta aero
  I''ma break before I lay floor berry
  Besides, every rapper ain''t a star, nigga plad ain''t bulbary
  You can''t tame Lloyd, smokin by the big screen
  You changin the channel looks like I''m playin the game boy
  I know to watch botherin ya vision
  You reach and I''ll put a dot on ya head like its part of yo religion
  Why party wit a pigeon?
  I''m blowin a 10 cuz Bush handin flyers for a party in a prison
  I''m in the gucci vest wit the green and red straps
  I''m the last rapper to scare niggas since Craig Mack
  Now every morning''s a fast start
  And there aint problem gettin dressed cuz my closet got more aisles than path
mark
  Run, move startin a wave
  and leave wit 12 shells in ya mouth like a carton of eggs
  I''m the young pimp pardon my age
  I don''t got long hair but if I did she be puttin my braids
  Niggas find what club they at
  take ''em wit us, and run a train on ''em like a subway mac
  get advances from grey agra
  see these record labels got most artists gettin fucked like the gay rappa''
  i go the college on the tour
  I''m goin down in history nigga, next to Wallace and Shakur
  I keep ya ammo clean, text polished in the drawer
  Camera''s by the hamper that mine into the floor
  by now, you probably heard of me
  fresh outta surgery, flashy as a fuck, you gon'' have to murder me
  Burglary, I''m leavin wit cha nike''s bergendy, White T, bergendy
  you match now, back down
  niggas love to hate you, but love you when you disappear
  catch me on the boat wit weed smoke and official gear
  heavy when I toke, C notes from different years
  Besly in the robe, re motes for liftin chairs
  You ain''t rich, but we glad to snatch ya
  I send cars to crib like I''m a cab dispatcha
  you better off wit ya stupid guys, lookin for a coupe to drive
  you ain''t gettin nuttin but ya french fries supersized
  it''s a damn shame y''all still local
  I''m in a million dollar studio layin my vocals

  Still in the projects nigga, you ain''t goin nowhere

  If you shoot me your brainless, you said it yourself
  I''m slick enough to twist your lines and send them back at you
  Swift enough to snatch the mack and pop that at you
  Take it personal see if I won''t send you to hell
  I''ve done told Ton and Pok? they better have my bail
  But if its over a mil don''t put the crib up dun
  Cause if 50 get free nigga, 50 gonna run
  [Chorus] 2x
  It''s best you be a gentleman
  and you watch what you say (bwahh bwahh, nigga take that)
  Or Jesus Christ can''t save you once you go gangsta, friend

  Look I''m supposed to be cocky, I ain''t a po'' no mo''
  I ain''t gotta steal from the corna'' store no mo''
  Got my own crib, I ain''t sleepin'' on the flo'' no mo''
  Bouncers don''t try to play me at the do'' no mo''
  But when they see me they say search him
  &quot;He might have the nine
  He might shoot this motherfucker up like Shyne&quot;
  It''s been a while since a new nigga came tight like this
  Ya man, he aight, but he ain''t quite like this
  Niggas is feelin'' it
  The Benz pullin up on the set (uh huh)
  Me jumpin out 30 tho on my neck (uh huh uh huh)
  And since you said it was nothin'' to sweat (what)
  That you was outta line so here''s what you get
  A verbal ass kickin''
  Jesus Christ sent me to test ya
  Let''s see how see how he act''s under pressure
  Till Makaveli returns it''s ''All Eyez On Me''
  Till the feds build up cases and find pie''s on me
  [Chorus] 2x
  It''s best you be a gentleman
  and you watch what you say (bwahh bwahh bwahh, bwahh nigga take that)
  Or Jesus Christ can''t save you once you go gangsta, friend
  (bo! bo! bo!, It''s gangsta)
  It''s gangsta, 2000 shit

 See I''m tired of all these rappin niggas dyin to shine
 And I''m tired of fiends askin for a dime for nine
 Hearing this next punch line from me, may sound strange

 Yo the sale went stale, caught em real bad
 Fresh out the jail, shit is really real
 Niggas is still in jail, and I pray they don''t tell
 20 man inditement, my lawyer gotta fight this
 Niggas know, I ain''t never pressed for dough

 You know how it is on the street, niggas is holdin the heat
 Po Po walking to beat, we burnin l''s up in the jeep
 Ain''t nothing sweet, we used to move so strategic
 It''s over I can''t believe it, damn it''s over
 Fed''s ceased the six, the Lex'' and the Range Rover
 Now a nigga rollin in a Toyota Corolla
 Used to never get high, now I''m never sober
 380 6 shot glock top load up
 Keep it in my waist son, I''ll put one in your face
 I ain''t got nothing to lose, nigga so stay in your place
 Just jumped bail, I ain''t been on the run long

  I went back to the Range
  I heard her Girlfriend whisperin'' &quot;I know that nigga, he rich&quot;
  she think I got six whips ''cause me and my Man switch
  anyway, her name is CeCe
  she said she go to BMCC
  push a ''98 328 with chrome BB''s
  she said she seen me in the Onyx video on TV
  she liked my part the best, man, this bitch is tryin'' to G me.
  [Chorus]
  [Verse 2:]
  It''s hard as Hell to find a Girl thats really down for ya
  type that''ll hold down the Tre pound for ya
  they into diamonds now, to Hell with pearls
  these trick niggas fucked up, they done gave ''em the World
  Hey Shorty, why you like me? huh? you like the way I spit?
  oh, I hit your girlfriend, she told you ''bout the dick?
  nah for real, am I the type that you wanna roll wit''?
  platinum iced out, got rid of that gold shit
  I love my lifestyle, you too, you love it
  that I could blow Twenty Thousand and think nothin'' of it
  know you wouldn''t fuck with me if I had no ends
  probably wouldn''t fuck in the whip if it wasn''t a Benz
  I guess life looks different through them Shanel tints
  Man, I don''t care if these hoes love me or not
  long as I rhyme hot I''m gettin'' head in my drop
  it goes on and on and on and it don''t stop.
  [Chorus]
  [Verse 3:]
  One thing you can always count on is change
  and a rich nigga to come put shit in the game
  had a 4.0 then Jigga made you trade your Range
  would''ve felt broke if you couldn''t get your change
  now it''s hard to find us or stay behind us
  while we on the 900 double R Hondas
  watch the cats who flip bricks recline in the latest whips
  while Penetentiaries stay packed with cats who sling packs
  all these hoes ain''t Madonna fans but all across the World
  you can find a material Girl
  I sip Dom ''till I earl
  take ''em two at a time
  quick I get in they mind
  have ''em thinkin'' they mine
  bust off then tell ''em &quot;Bust a Uey, on mo'' time&quot;
  I''m like the reason ya''ll niggas can''t eat this year
  got your bitch breakin'' her neck to peep this here
  c''mon..uh huh...c''mon.

 Either I''m trippin'' off the ecstasy
 Or I could feel the world turnin''
 I''m havin'' flashbacks, I can feel the shells burnin''
 Comin'' up, I was taught never back down
 That''s why I act the way I act now, hold the mac down
 32 shots, squeeze til there ain''t a shell left
 Come with my gun smokin'', you can smell death
 They get the first laugh, I get the last laugh homie
 Hit the gas on it, pull up and mash on ''em
 There''s a lot of talk in the streets about me
 Niggaz know, ain''t nothing sweet about me
 Get back to questions, like &quot;50, who shot ya?...
 You think it was Preme, Freeze or Tah, Tah?&quot;
 Nigga, street shit should stay in the street
 So, keep it on the low
 But everybody who''s somebody already know
 A few words for any nigga that get hit the fuck up
 My advice if you get shot down, is get the fuck up
 LET''S GO
 Chorus (Different Variations)
 [Verse]
 Maaaaaaaaan
 I told niggaz not to fuck with me they still push me
 Figured they''d get away with it cause Tone and Poke pussy
 I been gone through static, shot at with automatics
 Since 90, when Nas came out with &quot;Illmatic&quot;
 If Suge was home, Death Row would be good for me
 Cause Tommy Matola ain''t shootin out in the hood wit me
 I''ve been shot 9 times my nigga that''s why I walk funny
 Hit in the jaw once, why I talk funny
 With a Ruger on my hip, I walk the street with no care
 Think my grandma''s prayers the only reason I''m here
 My wrist icy, keep my ears icy, keep my neck icy
 That''s why you bitch like me, so I''m a heavyweight
 How dare these niggaz take me lightly?
 I ain''t come to make friends and niggaz aint gotta like me
 My own homie said &quot;50, you done lost yo'' mind&quot;
  Cause I shootout in broad day, run and toss my nine
  Chorus [Different Variations]
  [Verse]
  Can''t find a nigga in the hood, that say &quot;50 ain''t hot&quot;
  When I drop, I''m sound like Eminem and Kid Rock
  Play the block, with the watch all rocked the fuck up
  Jukes me, A week later y''all be shot the fuck up
  Born a healthy baby, I wasn''t always crazy
  This aint how moma rasied me, this how the hood made me
  The D''s call me by my government name
  I be dumb and shoot up parks
  Have niggaz runnin'' like &quot;Jesus Comin''&quot;
  There''s wet pillows in prison, niggaz cry in the dark
  Cause if they did in the day, niggaz would question they heart
  So when they come home, the come home
  Walking that tough walk, talking that &quot;Rockavalede&quot;
  Talk''ll get you shot in New York BBBBLLLLATTTTT
  Sex, money, murder, I gotta eat
  But I aint tryin do Hard Time like Pistol P
  See, niggaz uptown understand me in the street
  You niggaz uptown''ll &quot;Stan&quot; me in the street

GHETTO QU''RAN (FORGIVE ME)
[talking]
  Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
  Southside, what y''all niggas know about the dirty south?
  One time
  [Chorus]
  Lord forgive me, for I''ve sinned
  Over and over again, just to stay on top
  I recall memories, filled with sin
  Over and over again, and again
  Yo, when you hear talk of the southside, you hear talk of the team
  See niggas feared Prince and respected Preme
  For all you slow muthafuckas I''m a break it down iller
  See Preme was a business man and Prince was the killer
  Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh huh
  This here get ya seasick, I sat back and peeped shit
  The roll with Easy Rider and they ain''t get blunted
  Had the whole projects workin for fifty on five hundred
  As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack
  I used to idolize cat
  Heart me in my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pat, how he go out like
  that?
  Rumors in the hood was ?? was snitchin
  I ain''t believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSX R
  Had the four runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3
  Used to drive his truck through the hood draggin jet skis
  From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don''t be suprised
  Of how freely I thought of names of games who dealt with pies
  Like L A N Y''s, L got shot in the neck, then told us connect
  Them niggas who shot ''em got ''em for ten bricks
  Fuckin Dominicans, turned around and gave ''em more bricks
  [Chorus]
  That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I''m on
  Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto''s Quran
  I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Remmy and Joe
  And Prince and Rightous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
  Throughout my struggles through the hood, I started learnin
  Life''s a bitch, with a pretty face, but she burnin
  Man I''m a get cheese like Chaz then run through wips like Cigar
  Gamble all the time like country curly head Prince and Tata
  Po po under pressure too, they know what they facin
  Go against crews like B Bo and killers like Patty Mason
 A lotta niggas I know been corrupted since birth
 Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth
 I know some cats that hail at old complexes like Cooley Wall
 Together niggas stand and divided they fall
 Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion
 Come around here with your rollie you can get robbed like Ocean
 Lord knows, Tommy had loved and sold
 Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louie VaTonne interior
 Might sound like I''m fantasizin, but son I''m dead serious
 Montanna was no dummy, brought Benice to watch the money
 Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian
 FEDs couldn''t catch him dirty so settled for tax evasion
 [Chorus]
 Yo, rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about yo
 The twins was some queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
 Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy, Jamaican Pauly, Ducky
 Cally
 Rodney Bump and Chick, shit
 A lot a niggas flow the way I flow
 but ain''t been in the game all their life so don''t know who I know
 Writin rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
 If I ain''t rich by twenty six, I''ll be dead or in jail
 Comin up I heard sippin to much booze''ll leave you confused
 And if you watch the news you see playas in this game that lose
 I''m forgettin Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance
 Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags
 And a conversation over shrimp and lobster
 And Benny Hiners heard Chico stopped boxin, and started robbin diners
 Shout out to Clanvis and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will
 If the flow don''t kill you the Mac will

  Catch you slippin, I''ma kill you I ain''t playin, hear what I''m sayin,
  homie I ain''t playin
  [50 Cent]
  Keep thinkin I''m candy till ya fuckin skull get popped
  And ya brain jump out the top like Jack in da box
  In the hood summer time is the killing season
  It''s hot out this bitch that''s a good ''nuff reason
  I''ve seen gangsta''s get religious when they start bleedin
  Sayin &quot;Lord, Jesus Help Me&quot; cause they ass leakin
  When they window roll down and that A.K. come out
  You can squeeze ya lil handgun until you run out
  And you can run for ya back up
  But them machine gun shells gone tear ya back up
  God''s on ya side, shit I''m aight wit that
  We reload them clips and come right back
  It''s a fact homie, you go against me ya fucked
  I get the drop, if you can duck, ya luckier then Lady Luck
  Look nigga, don''t think you safe cause you moved out the hood
  Cuz ya momma still around dog, and daddy ain''t good
  If you was smart you''d be shook of me
  Cuz I''d get tired of lookin for ya, spray ya momma crib, and let ya ass look
  for me
  (Chorus)
  [50 Cent]
  My heart bleeds for you nigga, I can''t wait to get to you
  Behind that twinkle in ya eyes, I can see the bitch in you
  Nigga you know the streets talk
  So they''ll be no white flags and no peace talks
  I got my back against the wind, I''m down to ride till the sun burn out
  If I die today, I''m happy how my life turned out
  See the shootouts that I''ve been in I''m by myself
  Locked up I was in a box by myself
  I done made myself a millionaire by myself
  Now, shit changed motherfucker I can hire some help
  I done heard about the 50 grand you put in the hood
  But ya shooter fin''nin to get get shot it won''t do ''em no good
  With a pistol I define the definition of pain
  If you survive ya bones''ll still fuckin hurt when it rain
  Oh you a pro at playin battleship well this ain''t the same
  Lil homie this is a whole different type of war game
  See the losers and up in shackles of motherfuckin chains
  Or laid out in the streets leakin out they brains
  (Chorus)
  [50 Cent]
  After the fist fights it''s gunfire boy you get the best of me (best of me)
  If you don''t wanna get shot I suggest you don''t go testin me (testin me)
  All the wrong I''ve done the Lord still keep on blessin me (blessin me)
  Fin''nin to run rap cuz Dr. Dre got the recipe (the recipe, recipe)
  Yeah, uh ha, aye Dre
  You got me feelin real bulletproof up in this motherfucker
  Cuz my windows on my motherfuckin Benz is bulletproof nigga
  Cuz my motherfuckin vest is bulletproof nigga
  Cuz my motherfuckin hat is bulletproof nigga
  But the Doc said if I get hit I might get a fuckin concussion
  Better that then a hole in the head right nigga, heh heh ha ha

HIGH ALL THE TIME
(Chorus)
  I don''t need Dom Perignon, I   don''t need Cris
  Tanqueray and Alize, I don''t   need shit
  Nigga I''m high all the time,   I smoke that good shit
  I stay high all the time, man   I''m on some hood shit
  Give me some dro, purple haze, and some chocolate
  Give me a dutch and a lighter I''ll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I''m high all the time, man I''m on some hood shit
(Verse 1)
Everytime I ROLL up, niggas holla ROLL up, and I tell''em HOLD up,
You ain''t gettin money you ain''t smoking
In my Benzo, 20 inch Lorenzos, smoking on indo
Hiiigh as a motherfucker
I be on them backstreets, niggas know I clap heat, only if you got beef
Man you better holla at me
Niggas get locked up, stabbed up, shot up
Everytime I pop up, a lot going on in my hood
I shoot the dice, I holler get''em girls
Daddy need new shoes
Daddy need Perelli''s to look mean on 22s
Stash box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone
Bulletproof this bitch and I''m gone
2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny
The D''s sick, they searched the whip and they can''t find the semis
They was just harassing me cause they know who I was
Spent the night in Central Booking for smoking some bud

(Chorus)
(Verse 2)
Now if you heard I done started some shit
It ain''t because I be high (I be high, I be high)
And if you heard I done let off a clip
It ain''t because I be high (I be high, I be high)
But I twist that la, la, la, la
I get high as I wanna nigga
Go against me, fa sho, you''s a goner nigga
I don''t smoke to calm my nerves but I got beef
Finna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish
If you love me, tell me you love me, don''t stare at me man
I''d hate to be in the Benz clapping one of my fans
Let me show you how to greet me, when you meet me, when you see me
If you real my nigga, you know how to holla &quot;G Unit!&quot;
There''s no competition, it''s just me,
50 Cent, motherfucker, I''m hot on these streets
If David could go against Goliath with a stone
I can go at Nas and Jigga, both for the throne

(Chorus)
(Verse 3)
Now who you know besides me who write lines and squeeze nines
And have hoes in the hood sniffin on white lines
You don''t want me to be your kid''s role model
I''ll teach them how to buck them 380s and load up them hollows
Have shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib, sippin Guinness, watching Menace
Then Oh Lord, have a young nigga bucking shit like he O Dog
My team they depend on me when it''s crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like it''s lunchtime
You feeling brave nigga, go ahead get gully
See if I won''t leave your brains leaking up out your skully
  I done made myself hot, so ain''t shit you can tell me
  Niggas calling me to feature, man fuck your money
  I ain''t hurting, I''m doing good
  I ain''t got to write rhymes, I got bricks in the hood
  (Chorus)
  G Unit, are you   ready
  G Unit, are you   ready
  G Unit, are you   ready
  Nigga, ready or   not, here I come, come, come

HOW TO ROB
[Madd Rapper]
  The art of getting robbed
  This is how we do Brooklyn style boy you know what I''m sayin?
  [50 Cent]
  R.I.P B.I.G, R.I.P P A C, R.I.P niggas that wanna OD
  Aiyyo the bottom line is I''ma crook with a deal
  If my record don''t sell I''ma rob and steal
  You better recognize nigga I''m straight from the street
  These industry niggaz startin to look like somethin to eat
  I''ll snatch Kim and tell Puff, &quot;You wanna see her again?&quot;
  Get your ass down to the nearest ATM
  I have dreams of fuckin an R&amp;B bitch
  And I''ll wake up early and bounce with all your shit
  When I apply pressure,son it aint even funny
  I''m about to stick Bobby for some of that Whitney money
  Brian McKnight, I can get that nigga anytime
  Have Keith sweatin starin down the barrel from my nine
  Since these Harlem World niggaz seem to all be fam
  I put the gun to Cardan tell him, &quot;Tell your man
  Mason Betha, haha, come up of that watch now
  I mean right now&quot;
  The only excuse for being broke is bein in jail
  An entertainer can''t make bail if he broke as hell
  I''d rob ODB but that''d be a waste of time
  Probably have to clap him run and toss the nine
  I''d follow Fox in the drop for four blocks
  Plottin to juice her for that rock Kurupt copped
  What Jigga just sold like 4 mil? He got somethin to live for
  Don''t want no nigga puttin four thru that Bentley Coupe door
  I''ll man handle Mariah like &quot;Bitch get on the ground&quot;
  You ain''t with Tommy no more who gonna protect you now?
  I been skeamin on Tone and Poke since they found me
  Steve know not to wear that platinum shit around me
  I''m a klepto nah for real son I''m sick
  I''m bout to stick Slick Rick for all that old school shit
  Right now I''m bent and when I get like this I don''t think
  About to make Stevie J take off that tight ass mink
  I''ll rob Pun without a gun snatch his piece then run
  This nigga weigh 400 pounds, how he gon catch me son?
  [Madd Rapper](Chorus) 2x
  This aint serious
  Being broke can make you delirious
  So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
 50 Cent how it feel to rob and industry nigga?
 [50 Cents]
 Ill catch P and Silk The Shocker right after the Grammies
 And Will Smith and Jada ass down in Miami
 Run up on Timberland and Missy w/the pound
 Like you gimme the cash and u put the hot dog down
 I figured it out
 Been robbin Joe before that''s why his ass
 don''t wanna be a playa no more
 Mad at you I''m robbin J.D., FUCK YOU!! PAY ME!!
 Had Da Brat with em, shoulda had his gat with him
 DMX wanna get down well you tell homey
 I''m on that Treach shit, I do my Dirt All By My Lonely
 I should rob Clue man his shit did well
 I wanna stick TQ but his shit ain''t sell
 I hit the studios take shit and leave
 Catch Rae Ghost and RZA for them funny ass rings
 Tell Sticky gimme the cash before I empty three
 Ill beat your ass like that white boy on MTV
 Cannibus wanna battle while I''m stickin them up
 Nigga get capped coroners pickin em up
 Heavy tried to hide his shit, nigga try to stall ya
 He said &quot;Why you robbin me I got Nuttin But Love for ya!&quot;
 Caught Juvenile for his Cash Money piece
 Told him I want it all he said, &quot;Even my gold teeth?&quot;
 I caught Blackstreet on a back street in a black jeep
 One at a time get out and take off your shine
 Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
 Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
 Did you ever think that I''d flash the nine?
 And walk off with your shit like it''s mine?
 I''ma keep stickin niggas until I''m livid
 I''ll rob Boys II Men like I''m Michael Bivins
 Catch Tyson for half that cash like Robyn Givens
 I''m hungry for real im bout to stick Mister C
 That nigga still eatin off Big''s first LP
 I had Busta and the whole Flipmode on the floor
 He asked me if I had enuff I told him &quot;Gimme Some More&quot;
 Is you feelin this? Then wait for the sequel
 I gotta get Kirk Franklin for robbin Gods People
 [Madd Rapper]
 (chorus)
 For real yo you know what I''m sayin?
 Niggas got to get stuck up that''s just how it goes down
 It don''t matter if you an industry nigga or a regular nigga
 It don''t matter, if you got it and I need it I want it
 50 Cents ain''t fuckin around
 Track Masters ain''t fuckin around
 Crazy Cat ain''t fuckin around
 The Madd Rapper aint fuckin around
 So watch your backs, watch your pocket book, watch your pockets
 Watch everybody on the train, watch everybody on the bus
 Cause we gonna get you whether you like it or not

  You niggas get so emotional (emotional)
  You remind me of my bitch.
  It''s not in my nature to make a commitment so let me breathe,
  But she doesn''t understand catch attitudes when I leave her (leave her)
  Like being on probation makin'' it harder for me to except her
  as my own she tries to tie up my phone and (phone and)
  I''m not at home she''s thinkin'' that I''m not alone probably out tryin'' to
 bone anything in the street
  I let her know she can leave I ain''t tryin to tie her up but see
  it''s hard to fuck with somebody after she touches me mami
  I''m not your regular nigga I know the game (I know the game)
  But I don''t play by the rules I''m focusin'' on my moves that way I''ll neve
r lose
  See I can tell by your shoes if you attracted to Benz''s with 22''s
  Say I confuse you play little tricks with your head
  Catchin'' feelin''s ever since the first time I slept in your bed
  I''m not here to tease you mislead you or mess up your dreams (nah)
  I can''t say I love you I dont know what that means
  I''ma pimp.
 [Chorus: (x2)]
 Girl you know I like it when you climb on top
 Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock
 And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
 Take me to extasy without taking Extasy
 [Verse 2:]
 When I first met her
 I did anything to get her (what?)
 Paid all her bills and filled the ''fridgerator (uh huh)
 Reminiscin'' on late nights when I try to lay up
 but couldn''t get off cause your baby would stay up
 She even crashed the whip tryin'' to switch in the third lane
 That''s when I realized this bitch was a bird brain
 A pigeon writin'' her baby pops in the box in the prison
 Sing sing is where he biddin''
 She in the Gucci tights and Findi high heals
 Baby wipes and cans of Infamil
 Moter bike and grams of fish scale
 It''s a 9 to 5 niggas with no frills
 Turnin'' young niggas with princables to old men with debts
 And all the prank calls was death threats that bitch had the best sex
 All across the globe and the bitch head game was out of control
 [Chorus: (x2)]
 Girl you know I like it when you climb on top
 Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock
 And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
 Take me to extasy without taking Extasy
 [Verse 3:]
 I''m wonderin'' when I''m gone if you''ll miss me (miss me)
 or do you miss the Don Perion and the Cristy
  I''m fuckin'' with you
  I''m feelin'' your shape I''m feelin'' your eyes
  Later on I''m feelin'' your ass and feelin'' your thighs (come here baby)
  Sweet heart your book smart and street smart (uh huh)
  I knew you was my type from the very very start (yeah)
  I''m into tongue kissin'' and four play all day
  Mama ain''t home so the noise is okay
  O.D.B you know he like it the raw way
  Latex safe sex no hickeys on the neck
  Now you learnin'' (whoo)
  The Lords blessin'' makes me wiser as the world''s turnin''
  My tongue touch the right spot have your toes curlin''
  Whether we''re just kickin'' it or sexin'' (uh huh) I''m a pro baby girl I sp
it game to perfection (Yeah)
  So when niggas make mistakes I correct them and
  When niggas get out of line I check them man

    Girl you know I like it when you climb on top
    Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock
    And you know I love the way you make the bed rock

  Oh yes

    Uh huh, yeah
    I wanna be the reason you smile after you wipe your tears
    The reason you have the courage to confront your fears
    The reason there''s two karats in each your ears
    I sperge with the paper ma'', I don''t care
    How ya like the pumps, boots, jeeps, coops
    Make celebs fifty fall off never
    What''s mine is yours and what''s yours is mine
    So when I shine you shine
    Camon and fine the champagne, we can toast to life
    Crap table in Vegas, you can toss the dice
    Don''t let your friends get you confused saying 50 bad news
I need ya in my life girl you''re too good to loose
(J Lo)
It''s funny cuz for a while
I walked around with a smile but
Deep inside I could hear voices telling me this ain''t right
Don''t you know it''s not for you
I always knew what I had to do
But its hard to get away
''Cause I love you I just tried to stay
(Chorus)
I used to say I couldn''t do it but I did it
After telling everbody that i wasn''t with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I''m a be alright
I said I couldn''t do it but I did it
After telling everbody that i wasn''t with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I''m gonna be alright

(J Lo)
Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You''re not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize I can''t change you
(Chorus)
(J Lo)
Said I wouldn''t walk away
Somedays I want to stay
But leaving you is what I need to do to be okay
Never thought it would be true
Me living without you
But now it''s time for me to make that move
(50 Cent)
Yeah
Uh huh
Yeah
Now when I tell you what my wishes are you don''t respect it
When I smile at you, you don''t smile back to recconect it
You ain''t even gone long but I already miss you
I need you next to me so I can hug you and kiss you
All the talkin on the phone
All the time we share
How could you fix your mouth to say I don''t care
I had plans for us to buy ice together
Engagement rings and things and share life together
Now when your friends tell you 50 called you like whatever
Do you think we were wrong for each other from the start
Or was it my actions that made us fall apart
Just want you to know you''ll always have a place in my heart
 (Chorus)
 (J Lo)
 Oh no
 Be alright yes
 Oh no
 Says I''m gonna be alright

I''M A HUSTLER
Rule number one don''t go against the grain
  Rule number two give respect where respect due
  Rule number three if you get knocked play games and say names
  (gun click sound) the 45 will tear you out the frame
  Its like the rich get richer and the poor don''t get fuckin thing
  Don''t mean nothin changed but the things my money bring
  My style will leave you aggy like them cats in jail
  You peoples got pleany money actin like they ain''t got bail
  I feel for you niggas gettin shot while I''m sayin this rhyme
  Or niggas in the mess hall gettin shot on shallow lines
  An old timer schooled me don''t burn bridges my friend
  Imagine the G Dub close and yo ass gotta swim
  I watch the fifth melt a nigga melt a nigga of the sidewalk of New York
  Me and shorty saw from afar and had a talk
  He said I told em if he came around I''d clap him, I gave him my word
  Look at his head its still shakin he had alot of nerve

 I''d probably have to double Back bubble crack)

 3x

 Yo when the fed come in the game loyalty is limited
 Hardcore niggas start actin feminine
 With the feds you do eighty five percent of your time
 Duke you get ten you''ll damn near do nine
 Hate a liar more than I hate thief
 A thief is only after my salary a liar is after my reality
 The streets I know''em like my ABC''s
 Stay away from the D''s and stack ya cheese
 Try to see three hundred g''s fore you see three hundred C''s
 Tree top to feel the breeze co connect for key''s
 Yo bitches sexin me take me to ecstacy
 Once I nut (ahh oh shit) I don''t want ''em next to me
 If its on mother fucker believe I''m gonna ride
 I''m the type to swallow my blood fore I swallow my pride
 Letters on my shirt read DKNY
 Got grimy niggas runnin with me from BKNY
 (Chorus)
 They say I don''t sound like a killer well how a killer sound
 I bet I grab a foe pound and back that ass down
 See many men live baby and many men die
 Many men get drunk puff lah and stay high
 Here''s a jewel love you enemies and hate your friends
 Your enemies remain the same friends always change
 I don''t quit that theres more that one way to skin a cat
 You can get him in the face dog or down his back
 All bullshit aside now its time to be honest
 I fear no man for death is all thats promised
 I got niggas standin in line waitin to hear me spit
 From eighty six to ninety six the game went from sugar to shit
 This for you niggas in the background dyin to shine
 I hate you like fiends who ask for a dime for nine
 Don''t nothin change in the game but faces and names
 Skate to wait to date and the jake

  When streetlights come on niggaz blast the nines
  Get locked up, they read books to pass the time
  In the game there''s up''s and down''s, so I stay on the grind
  Niggaz on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind
  They aint nothin they could do to stop my shine
  This is God''s plan homey, this ain''t mine
  I played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance
  And Grandma; who always gotta throw a 100 percent
  I''m the drop out who made more more money than these teachers
  Roofless/Ruthless like the Coupe but I come with more features
  I am whut I am, you could like it or love it
  It feels good to pull 50 grand &amp; think nothin of it
  Fuck it

Playboy November issue page three was my wife

  For bitches who don''t know me
  ... They wanna blow me
  Cause the shit I floss wit sayin a lot for me
  [Verse One]
  I came into rap humble, I don''t give a fuck now
  Serve anybody like niggaz who hustle uptown
  Coke price go up, cats is come down
  The D''s run in my crib, I''m nowhere to be found
  The bitch who hustle for me, they dont even stash tracks
  They keep it on ''em, right there in they ass crack
  When I don''t like a nigga, I don''t pretend to
  I''ll have the paramedics wrap your fuckin head like a Hindu
  Look, I ain''t goin nowhere, so get used to me
  OG''s look at me and see what they used to be
  I''m that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope
  The nigga that shot Dice when he broke to So So
  The thug, they pop shit, the thug that pop clips
  The thug that went from three and a half to whole bricks
  Nigga ain''t in his right mind, goin against me
  My picture''s painted through words that make a blind man see

  Y''all niggaz don''t want no parts of me
  I''m tryna figure out how y''all started me
  Make me catch her on the late night
  Pop shots wit the fifth and slide off wit the six
  I''m not a marksmen while spark issue, I spray random
  Not a pretty nigga but my moms think I''m handsome
  I hate to hear &quot;He say, She say&quot; shit
  Unless he say she say she on my dick
  It''s no coincidence, niggaz who fuck wit me get shot up
  I do a Cali style drive by and tear ya block up
  You soft through, be puttin up a crazy front
  I stay wit the Mac, cause niggaz tried to blaze me once
  In the hood they be like, &quot;Damn, 50 really spitted on ''em&quot;
  &quot;You heard that shit?&quot; &quot;Yeah, 50 really shitted on ''em&quot;
  Beef, you don''t want none, so don''t start none
  You just a small player in this game, play a part son
  [Hook]
  [Verse Three]
  These cats always escape reality when they rhyme
  That''s why they write about bricks and only dealt wit dimes
  Leave it to them, and they say they got a fast car
  Nascar, truck wit a crash bar, and TV''s in the dash, pa
  See ''em in the five wit stock rims, I just laugh, pa
  I catch stunts when I ain''t tryin

  You get carried away, you can get shot and carried away
  Now here''s a list of MC''s that can kill you in eight bars:
  50, umm Jay Z and Nas
  I''ma say this shit now and never again

From the tellie in ten minutes I''ll make you a believer
Tongue touch ya''ll have ya shakin like you havin a seizure

G unit gang, can''t another clique out to see us
Niggas lip sync the lyrics cuz they wanna be us
Groupie hoes from the hood they be tryin ta G us
Try ta holla at the kid, e''ery time they see us
Girlfriend quit pretending I''m the nigga ya love
And I ain''t got to say nuttin you know that I''m thugin
Wit my hands on dat ass and ya say that I''m buggin

LOVE ME
[Obie Trice]
  You don''t see me in the hood, it''s cause I''m doing this man

  Niggas, I''m still grinding (yeah), I still hearing those sirens
  I''m still getting chased by those lights
  Only the light''s lime, and my mic''s on
  And my time is none, because I''m writing more
  I don''t hear to meet a soul in this business
  I''m here to eat, speak, until these ho''s feel this
  I ain''t gonna let you derail me, man
  I got Young Kobe homey, you gotta let go of Obie
  ''Cause Obie be back, (going nowhere, man) we got them craps going on
  And that rap going on, soon as a nigga touch down, back from town
  It''s forever, put that on the cheddar, man
  But in the meantime, it''s Jimmy Iovine time
  Chase cheese, rhyme ''til my voice give out
  This is it my niggas, this what we boast about
  Now I''m here, so shut your motherfucking mouth, and show me love, bitch
  [Chorus]
  I just wanna love, for the rest of my life (I don''t love you, bitch)
  I wanna hold you in the morn, hold you in the night
  (Right we wanna love alcohol, we wanna love guns, we wanna love money
  we don''t love no bitches, though)
  I just wanna love, for the rest of my life
  I wanna hold you in the morn, hold you in the night
  [Eminem]
  There''s a certain mystique when I speak, that you notice
  ''Cause it''s sort of unique ''cause you know it''s me
  My poetry''s deep, and I''m stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat
  You can''t sit still, it''s like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep
  I''m strapped, it''s known any minute I could snap
  I''m the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
  I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
  It ain''t even funny, I ain''t even hungry, it ain''t even money
  You can''t pay me enough for you to play me
  It''s cockamamey you just ain''t zany enough to rock with Shady
  My noodle is cock a doodle, my clock''s coo coo
  I got screws loose, yea the whole kitten caboodle, I''m just brutal
  It''s no rumor, I''m numero uno, assume it
  There''s no more humor in it, you know
  I''m rolling with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
  You need a fag and tear a near hole in my ass, you better love me, bitch
  [Chorus]
  [50 Cent]
  And all the bitches say
  My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name
  If it ain''t about the flow, it''s ''bout the stones and the chain
  If I was you, I''d love me too, I roll like a boss
  Nine eleven Porsche same color as cranberry sauce
  I ain''t gon'' front, I thought R. Kelly was the shit
  Let me find out he fucking ''round with Bow Wow bitch
  Niggas eating popcorn right, rewinding the tape
  Now shorty mama in precinct, hollering rape
  I''m convinced, man, something really wrong with these ho''s
  I thought Lil'' Kim was hot, ''til she start fucking with her nose
  I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet
  Then the bitch put out a CD and didn''t have no beats
  That boy D''Angelo, he determined not to fail
  That nigga went butt ass, for his record to sell
  My back shots ''ll help Ashanti hit them high notes
  And Big Ben taught Charli B''More to deep throat (yea)
  [Chorus]
  [50 Cent]
  I love the burners, the money, the bunnies, I just wanna hold you, ha ha
  I just wanna love you, yea

And if I don''t feel a nigga, I don''t get on his shit
Y''all can love me, or hate me, or suck my dick
I like my hoes just like Summer, no class
And niggas working so hard, and getting no ass
Why y''all niggas acting like, it''s all ill in y''all square
Motherfucker you ain''t know that it''s a hood everywhere
Me and 50 vandal, no we always run scandal
Weak niggas, have us lighting up candles
Sending out roses, condolences, notices
Focuses on, niggas like Fu Quan
Yo in they ground, niggas that don''t get no bound
Y''all keep my word, don''t love no bird
Get a beef from TM, and just twist my herb
(Chorus 50 Cent)
So now everybody wanna take money

Yo it''s all about the cash you getting
Bricks you flipping, the whips you sitting
The bitches you hitting, when you living the thug life
Bitches I don''t love no of ''em, the guns I''m running ''em
Punk niggas I''m sunning ''em, every chance I get
Man I know niggas is a trip, so I save all my grip
For these babies faggots flippin'', dial 1 800 TIPS
Force me to bury the bricks, and the whips and take trips
Every word that come out of my mouth, I mean it, you could eat
''Cause when I stick you, you gon'' cough it up like you bulimic
I''m no magician, but I could make, somethin'' outta nothin''
Like turn an empty block, into a crack spot that''s pumping
So all you niggas out there, thinking you the nicest
Me 50, I''m ya motherfucking mid life crisis

MANY MEN (WISH DEATH)
[Lloyd Banks]
  Man we gotta go get something to eat man
  I''m hungry as a motherfucker
  [50 Cent]
  Ay yo man, damn what''s taking homie so long son?
  [Lloyd Banks]
  50, calm down, here he come
  [9 Shots]
  [Banks and 50]
  Ahh, ohh, what the fuck!?
  [50 Cent]
  Ahh! son, pull up! pull up!
  [Intro: 50 Cent singing]
  Many men, wish death upon me
  Blood in my eye dawg and I can''t see
  I''m trying to be what I''m destined to be
  And niggaz trying to take my life away
  I put a hole in nigga for fucking with me
  My back on the wall, now you gon'' see
  Better watch how you talk, when you talk about me
  Cause I''ll come and take your life away
  Many men, many, many, many, many men
  Wish death ''pon me
  Lord I don''t cry no more
  Don''t look to the sky no more
  Have mercy on me
  [Verse One]
  Now these pussy niggaz putting money on my head
  Go on and get your refund motherfucker, I ain''t dead
  I''m the diamond in the dirt, that ain''t been found
  I''m the underground king and I ain''t been crowned
  When I rhyme, something special happen every time
  I''m the greatest, something like Ali in his prime
  I walk the block with the bundles
  I''ve been knocked on the humble
  Swing the ox when I rumble
  Show your ass what my gun do
  Got a temper nigga, go''head, lose your head
  Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
  I walk around gun on waist, chip on my shoulder
  Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain''t over
  [Chorus singing]
  Many men, many, many, many, many men
  Wish death ''pon me
  Lord I don''t cry no more
  Don''t look to the sky no more
  Have mercy on me
  Have mercy on my soul
  Somewhere my heart turned cold
  Have mercy on many men
  Many, many, many, many men
  Wish death upon me
  [Verse Two]
  Some days wouldn''t be special, if it wasn''t for rain
  Joy wouldn''t feel so good, if it wasn''t for pain
  Death gotta be easy, ''cause life is hard
  It''ll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
  This if for my niggaz on the block, twisting trees and cigars
  For the niggaz on lock, doing life behind bars
  I don''t see only god can judge me, ''cause I see things clear
  Quick these crackers will give my black ass a hundred years
  I''m like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
  Like Malcolm by any means, with my gun in my palm
  Slim switched sides on me, let niggaz ride on me
  I thought we was cool, why you want me to die homie?
  [Chorus]
  [Verse Three]
  Every night I talk to god, but he don''t say nothing back
  I know he protecting me, but I still stay with my gat
  In my nightmares, niggaz keep pulling techs on me
  Psych says some bitch dumb, put a hex on me
  The feds didn''t know much, when Pac got shot
  I got a kite from the pens that told me, Tuck got knocked
  I ain''t gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
  Are you illiterate nigga? You can''t read between the lines
  In the bible it says, what goes around, comes around
  Almost shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
  Now it''s clear that I''m here, for a real reason
  ''Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain''t fucking breathing
  [Chorus]
50CENT
P.I.M.P.
(Chorus)
  I don''t know what you heard about me
  But a bitch can''t get a dollar out of me
  No Cadillac, no perms, you can''t see
  That I''m a motherfucking P I M P
  (Repeat)
  (Verse 1)
  Now shorty, she in the club, she dancing for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her cause they wanna
I spit a little G man, and my game got her
A hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me cause I''m from New York
I ain''t that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head
I''m that nigga trying to holla cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid
Look baby this is simple, you can''t see
You fucking with me, you fucking with a P I M P
(Chorus)
(Verse 2)
I''m bout my money you see, girl you can holla at me
If you fucking with me, I''m a P I M P
Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch I''m a P I M P
Come get money with me, if you curious to see
how it feels to be with a P I M P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch TV
From the backseat of my V, I''m a P I M P
Girl we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl we could have it all
We could really splurge girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I''m the one you should call
I''ll be there to pick you up, if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve''em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain''t bout shit
I''m your friend, your father, and confidant, BITCH
(Chorus)
(Verse 3)
I told you fools before, I stay with the tools
I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels
I holla at a hoe til I got a bitch confused
She got on Payless, me I got on gator shoes
I''m shopping for chinchillas, in the summer they cheaper
Man this hoe you can have her, when I''m done I ain''t gon keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin know
You saying it''s secret, but you ain''t gotta keep it on the low
Bitch choose with me, I''ll have you stripping in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Nik my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your hoe out of pocket, I''ll put a charge on a bitch
Cause I need 4 TVs and AMGs for the six
Hoe make a pimp rich, I ain''t paying bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shiiit, TRICK
(Chorus)
Yeah, in Hollywoood they say there''s no b''ness like show b''ness
In the hood they say, there''s no b''ness like hoe b''ness ya know
 They say I talk a lil fast, but if you listen a lil faster
 I ain''t got to slow down for you to catch up, BITCH

PATIENTLY WAITING
Hey Em, you know you my favorite white boy, right?
  I, I owe you for this one
 [Chorus: 50 Cent]
 I been patiently waiting for a track to explode on (Yeah!)
 You can stunt if you want and ya ass''ll get rolled on (It''s Fifty!)
 If it feels like my flow has been hot for so long (Yeah!)
 If you thinking I''m a fuckin fall off ya so wrong (It''s Fifty!)
 [50 Cent]
 I''m innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
 Destination heaven
 Sittin politic with passengers from nine eleven
 The Lord''s blessins leave me lyrically inclined
 Shit I ain''t even got to try to shine
 God''s the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
 I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at yo dame
 Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
 Fifty fear no man, Warrior, swingin swords like Conan
 Picture me, pen in hand writin lines knowin the Source''ll quote it
 When I die, they''ll read this and say a genius wrote it
 I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
 I caught cases I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
 In this white man''s world, I''m similar to a squirrel
 Lookin for a slut wit a nice butt to get a nut
 If I get shot today my phone''ll stop ringin again
 These industry niggas ain''t friends, they know how to pretend
 [Chorus] repeat 2X
 [Eminem]
 If ya patiently waitin to make it through all the hatin
 Debatin whether or not you can even weather the storm
 Unless you lay on the table they operatin to save you
 It''s like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above
 They think they crazy but they ain''t crazy, let''s face it
 Shit basically they just playin sick
 They ain''t shit, they ain''t sayin shit, spray em'' fifty
 A to the K get in the way I''ll bring Dre and them wit me
 And turn this day into fuckin mayhem, you stayin wit me?
 Don''t let me lose you, I''m not tryna confuse you
 When I let loose wit this uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
 You get the messege? Am I gettin through to you?
 You know what''s comin, you motherfuckers don''t even know, do you?
 Take some Big and some Pac and you mix em'' up in a pot
 Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
 You got the realest and illest killas tied up in a knot
 The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
 It''s like a fight to the top just to see who''d die for the spot
 You put ya life in this, nothin like survivin a shot
 Y''all know what time it is, soon as fifty signs on this dot
 Shit what you know about death threats, cause I get a lot
 Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
  Them cowards fucked wit the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
  Better evacuate all children, its nuclear showers
  There''s nothin spookier
  Ya now about to witness the power of fuckin fifty
  [Chorus]
  [50 Cent]
  If the gun spark I''ll hear all of the shots go off
  It''s fifty, they say it''s fifty
  See a nigga layed out wit his fuckin top blown off
  It''s fifty, man that wasn''t fifty
  Don''t holla my name
  You shouldn''t throw stones if you live in a glass house
  And if you got a glass jaw you should watch yo mouth
  Cause I''ll break yo face
  Have yo ass runnin, mumblin to the jake
  You goin & 145;gainst me dog, you makin a mistake, I''ll split ya
  Leave ya lookin like the Michael Jackson jackets wit all them zippers
  I''m the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
  The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper
  Yo bitch a regular bitch, you callin her wifey
  I fucked and feed her fast food, you keeping her icey
  I''m down to sell records but not my soul
  Snoop said this in ninety four, & 147;We don''t love them hoes& 148;
  I got pennies for my thoughts now I''m rich
  See the twenties spinnin lookin mean on the six
  Niggas wearin flags cause the colors match they clothes
  They get caught in the wrong hood, they get filled up wit holes
  [Chorus] repeat 2X

  You mistaken me for somebody that you should be testin''
  You should be stressin'' up in the fucking teach you a lesson
  Rap 101''s in session, Em laced the track that I''m blessin
  Smith and Wesson''s the weapon in case you was guessin'', escape lesson
  Caps in my benze, I''m beginning to end
  Watch the 22 spin, My hoes a perfect ten
  I got shot but I got up and I''m back at it again
  Motherfuckers that thought I wouldn''t win but tend to be friends
  At first you fail, try, try, try, try again
  I''m the best don''t you get it, forget it, when I spit it its crazy
  You love it, admit it, you like that I live it, its shady
 Aftermath in your ass bitch!
 If it''s not a classic, when it''s done we trash it
 Flow I got it mastered
 Stunt and get yo'' ass kicked, bastard
 When messes get drastic
 Crock''s made out of plastic
 Cock and aim it blast it!
 Run nigga, now stash shit!
 [Chorus]
 I got places to go, got people to see
 The penitentiary ain''t the place for me
 I''m warning you to, not tempt me
 I''ll run up and squeeze it, put a whole in ya (whole in ya) (x2)
 If there''s a genie in a bottle of that Dom Perignon
 Imma drink til I get to that bitch
 Introduce me to the burbs, they gonna listen to my words
 In the hood they feel my shit & 150; Break it down!
 [Verse 2]
 Picture a perfect picture
 Picture me in a pimp hat
 Picture me starting shit
 Picture me busting my gat
 Picture police mad dey ain''t got a picture of that
 Picture me being broke
 Picture me smoking them stacks
 Picture me coming up
 Picture me bitch from rags
 Picture me blowing up
 Now picture me going back
 To my momma basement to live, shit
 Picture that!
 Where I''m from it''s a fact, you gotta watch yo'' back
 You wear a vest without gat, you''s a target jack
 Hustle hard, money stack, sell that dope, sell that crack
 Sell that pack, sell that gat, sell that pussy, holla back!
 50 cent, too legit, man I''m bent, I''m outta here!
 [Chorus]
 I got places to go, got people to see
 The penitentiary ain''t the place for me
 I''m warning you to, not tempt me
 I''ll run up and squeeze it, put a whole in ya, whole in ya (x2)
 [Outro]
 Ha ha, man I aint'' going to jail, not even to visit a   nigga
 You wanna holla at me, you write me
 Matta fact, you gotta send it to Sunset Blvd up in the   Mondreal
 Riding around in one of Dre''s Ferrari''s nigga
 Oh matter fact, I might be in Detroit, riding around 8   mile road
 You know, in one of Em''s joints and shit, ya heard
 I got places to go man, ya know
 Shady aftermath, we fittin'' start printin'' money, ha   ha ha
 Putting our faces on these motherfuckin'' bills, shit,   ha ha ha ha

  Behavin'' shadier than Wes Craven
  And you ain''t even gotta pay me
  I take pleasure of layin'' a nigga down daily
  You face me, punk it''s over, you''ll faint fast
  I''ve never fucked up to where I can''t whoop ya ass
  You''ll neck''ll get snapped with bare hands, fuck music
  Is he rappin''? It''s cool but fools, just don''t confuse it
  What happens: these dudes get rude then I lose it
  I''m scandalous, I blow ya two niggas off the atlas
  With a gat that''s bigger than Godzilla''s back nigga
  You are not realer, in fact you''re feel the effects
  Of a crack dealer, y''all presidents since he smacked
  And got a mack 10 with it, so I ain''t gotta rap
  But I''m thankful for that, don''t mistakin'' me black
  Cuz you''ll be stankin'' in the back of a fuckin'' Cadillac

  I''ma get snuffed, cuz I ain''t said enough to pipe down
  I pipe down, when the [White House] just wiped out
  When I see that little [Cheney] dike get sniped out
  Lights out, bitch adios, goodnight *gunshot* (AHH!)
  Now put that in ya little pipe and bite down
  Think for a minute cuz the hype just died down
  That I won''t go up in the Oval Office right now
  And flip whatever ain''t tied down upside down
  I''m all for America, fuck the government
  Tell that C. Delores Tucker slut to suck a dick
  Motherfuck ducked, what the fuck? son of a bitch
  Take away my gun, I''m gonna tuck some other shit
  Can''t tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
  Switchblade, with a little switch to switch blades
  And switch from a six to a sixteen inch blade
  Shit''s like a samurai sword or sensai
  Shit just don''t change to this day

If I''m broke, then I''m breakin'' up in the place where you layin''
You know, same shit every nigga done in his life
I look at this, why speak on when I want when I write
So why should I ever fear another man
If he bleed like I bleed, take a piss and he stand?
OK, you win, you can say we can''t rap
But no Source never made me not buy an album when they say it was whack
[Kuniva]
I walk in that party and just start bussin'' *gunshots and screaming*
Right after I hear the last verse of &quot;Self Destruction&quot;
This liquor makes me wanna blast the chrome
To let you know The Time without Morris Day and Jerome (nigga)
I''m low down and shifty, quickly call Swifty
To do a drive by on the tenth speed with 50
Ya feelin'' lucky? Squeeze
I catch you outside of Chuckie Cheese
With ya seed, you be an unlucky G
My lifestyle is unstable, a partyin'' addict
They said no fightin'' in the club so I brought me a ''matic
Coughin'' the static, I jump niggas, call me a rabbit
Poppin'' the tablet and guns that saw you in half
[Chorus: 50 Cent *sung* ]
Believe me, we run this rap shit, fo sheezy
Make makin'' millions look easy
Everywhere you turn you see me, you hear me
Believe me, before you see my pistol in 3 D
No time to call a peace treaty
Dial 911 cuz you need the police to help you believe me

I snatch the chalk from the sidewalk and piss on the curb
This is absurd, these street niggas twistin'' my words
We finally could &quot;Say Goodbye to Hollywood&quot;
Cuz Proof and Shyne man shit nothin'' in common
The nastiest band with gas in each hand
We never bow down to be a flash in the pan
No remorse, fuck ya stature dog
Nothin'' to do with hands when I clap at y''all
Put your jaw on the ground with the four and the pound
Then I''m gone outta town ''fore the law come around
So we can battle with raps, we can battle with gats
Matter of fact, we can battle for plaques (This rap game)

  Plus I made all the beats and wrote all the raps
  Well I really didn''t, but I did accordin'' to this contract
  I was thrown in the snow with nowhere to go
  Freezin'' 20 below, forced to join Bel Biv Devoe
  My little girl, she shouldn''t listen to these lyrics
  That''s why I glued her headphones to her ear to make sure she hear it

  Better watch where you walk
  On the streets of New York
  That''s how we get down
  22''s on the jeep
  Somthin'' deep in the seat
  When we creep wit the heat
  That''s how we get down
  (50 Cent)
  In the city, a young buck''ll tell you how the mac spit
  O.G. give ''em the word, you gonna get yo'' ass hit
  I don''t know why niggaz like to talk bad about me
  I''m the richest nigga they know without a G.E.D.
  Man it could be the money, it could be the ice
  It could be they''d like to be me and can''t live my life
  You should here they be sayin'' man &quot;50 be flippin''&quot;
  &quot;Shot my man over 7 grams, that nigga be trippin''&quot;
  I know death is promised, I don''t fear gettin'' murked
  It''s when a nigga half way killa ya homie, it hurts
  Now we can hit the club and get it crunked
  Or you could start some shit, and I could hit you with
  the pump, you can have it how you want
  But I know you like my style (Uh Huh)
  Ya like how I break it down, wanna get rich?
  I''ll show you how, take this pack, pump these pieces
  That''s how we get down
  [Chorus]
  Better watch how you talk
  Better watch where you walk
  On the streets of New York
  That''s how we get down

(50 Cent)
  Yo LA niggaz are the rowdy niggaz
  New Orleans niggaz is rowdy nigga
  D.C. niggaz is some rowdy niggaz
  New York Niggaz is the fucking wildest nigga

  Yo, your man could have ran when I rubbed him but he froze
  Son I ain''t even rock him to sleep, the nigga dozed
  The bitch could have helped you get rich, but she sold
  now you heartbroke, that''s what you get for lovin them hoes
  An ill flow with no beat, is incomplete, it''s like a stickup kid
  runnin round without no heat, it like a fifth with no kick
  a fiend with no hit, a willie with no wit
  A bad bitch that won''t blow dick
  It''s like a rollie with no ice, a gamblin spot with no dice
  Like fuckin supermodel bitches and not bustin off twice
  I murda any mic device, for the right price, I''m nice
  I only say tthings once, never twice, dont fuck with me
  Chorus: 50 Cent
  St. Louis niggaz is rowdy rowdy
 Cleveland niggaz is bout it bout it
 50 cent ain''t gonna kill ya nigga, don''t get doubted
 Got your gun, well don''t leave home without it
 The Memphis niggaz is rowdy rowdy
 Them Shytown niggaz is bout it bout it
 They''ll kill you and act like they don''t know shit about it
 Leave your body somewhere where no one can find it
 (50 Cent)
 Now if I pull out the gat and just push your wig back
 I bet niggaz will stand around sayin &quot;Damn who did that?&quot;
 I''m the type nigga to dare you to touch the ?
 I''m the type to borrow your gat and wont give the shit back
 Im F to the I F T Y C E N T
 Caress the ass gently, and back up Bentleys
 You thought she was pimpin, son I was in the Hamptons
 in a heart shaped hot tub with the bitch flappin
 I plan to take over New York and start expandin
 Was Bob Marley singin about tex when he sung &quot;I''m Jammin''&quot;
 Nigga fuck with my cash and I''ma blast yo'' ass
 Smash the glock out the stash in the dash in ??
 Flee in a flash, lay low let time go past
 If you survive the shots I''ma find yo'' ass
 Put the gat to your head and remind your ass
 I ain''t playin with you, I want my money motherfucker
 Chorus
 (50 Cent)
 Yo, some nigga just shot the block up dog, word?
 He had the same shit you got on dog, word?
 I know you done did it so get the fuck up outta hear, ya heard?
 I run with niggaz that spray and strip and say that shit
 You won''t let us pump on your block, fuck it, we makin it hot
 I''m that nigga that call the shots, with the iced out watch
 From the cordless cell phone, and the baby blue drop
 I got a lot of hungry niggaz with me straight from the street
 Cause these three niggaz are startin to look like something to eat
 They got watches on they wrist that cost like 60 thousand
 My niggaz live in section eight of public housing
 They murder you and keep shit low cause niggaz heard of you
 Chorus 2X

SAY WHAT YOU WANT
Yo, niggas be askin me &quot;yo 50 who you got beef wit?&quot;

  If I can''t make no money wit you, fuck you nigga
  G Unit nigga, thats whatsup cause I said thats whatsup
 [Tony Yayo]
 I get money, money I got
 so its a 100 grams or better when I''m going to cop
 I never hold the toaster cause I use my little soldier
 And my down bitch as a holster, like I''m supposed ta
 heavy pistol sales for living
 my gun rip through lungs and tear through tissue
while I''m out for the ends, you out for a rep
thats the same thing that have yo mama in a black dress
see me in a black lex, hard top
My mink drop top, fresh out the carlot
I got the gift of raw pugilist speeches(?)
So I''m gon sell like the box office features
Niggas in the hood can''t see G UNIT!
but deep in they heart they wanna be G UNIT!
cause we got them three b''s: benzes, burners and bitches
and plus we on the road to the riches
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You can say what you want about me
As long as you don''t get in the way of my money
Cause all that talking shit to me played out
Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out
[Lloyd Banks]
Lately I been going through a phase
Hope they aint tap the phones
Cause we got pumps the size of saxophones
Therefore I''m on the move with the squad
I''m stingy as ever, known to trick fast food on a broad
Picture me putting jewels on a broad
I''d rather put shoes on the car
A pool in the yard
You don''t really wanna fool with the god
Nigga my front line long enough to fill two boulevards
In this game, you only make it far if you loyal
And if you grew up with your mother and your father you spoiled
Why swing, you gotta be strapped to get rid of me
Ill leave you in water like the statute of liberty
Tryin to be cool
Blowin green that strong enough to make a white boy open fire on a school
Keep rappin for your hood, I''m rappin for benzes
And long assault rifles with straps on the lenses
[Chorus]
[50 Cent]
Yall niggas gotta learn from me (Yeah!!)
What I learned from Gotta Rock and Spank G (Un Huh)
Yall niggas gotta learn from me (Yeah!!)
What I learned from watching Brucie B
Look, I shot the sheriff
And nigga if you get too close yo punk ass getting shot
Here''s the plan, I''m a keep stackin my ends
Till I''m on airplane seats in the Maebach benz
I''m all about the chips
I done took them trips
22''s on the 6
26 on the bricks
And them outta town niggas, I''m chargin yall more
I tapdance on the shit I aint servin it raw
You sell smoke, look nigga I got what you need
But it aint goin cheap I got mouths to feed
Niggas always sayin damn 50 you bugged
Cause I got hoes giving niggas the date rape drug
Gimme his watch and his chain
We not the same, he a lame
 He want pussy I''m bout my money man
 Crap table in Vegas had his bitch on my dick
 Threw a 7 so many times they thought the dice was fixed
 Yo its 50, when your mindframe change and start to rearrange
 I''ll see you another day motherfucker it''s 50
 Shots ''til your heart drop and freeze up, ease up motherfucker

  Broke niggas, smoke niggas, rich niggas smoke Cohiba''s
  My team been puffing chiba and packing heaters since the days of shell toe Ad
idas
  And ain''t shit come between us
  Look I''m winning now and I''ma keep on winning
  I see with you ain''t nothing changed same ginen same linen
  Fuck the don shit, nigga I''m an armed convict
  I live wild beat cases before a trial
  Grand jury style I''m foul
  You wondering why I don''t smile
  I''m schemeing to stick you up now
  Son I be the first to blast the gun, the last to run
  While you hit the pavement son I mash you, ugh
  If you don''t know you better go and ask someone
  50 Cent is my symbol and my name
  Symbolizing the change that I''m bringing to this game
  Things''ll never be the same (never the same baby)
 [Chorus]
 Yo nowadays niggas talk like they wanna get shot
 Like I won''t grab the glock and run up in your spot
 Six double O drop I''ll put two in your knot
 And stick around and get every motherfucking thing you''ve got
 Here I stand on the alley on godrule
 Same spot where rob got shot
 The block''s high
 Warrent squad flashing my mug shot
 Everybody know I''m loco, kill the popo, blast the fo fo, rode dolo
 Rock solo, I should be old T on the low yo
 Pump the six and push the volvo
 I hear they go kuku and go puff loco
 I sell llelo and price up and down like yo yo
 But keep that on the low do, nobody''s supposed to know, yo
 I make 16 hundred off of every ho do
  Fucking with the cash flow that''ll get you blast yo (haha)
  I always get the last laugh yo
  [Chorus]
  I rap a muthafucking house around my my wrist for wreck
  While you niggas race neck to neck
  While niggas who live from cheque to tech
  I ain''t even going to front I ain''t working with a full deck
  Life in the hood so hard I done lost some of my cards
  Instead of praying before I sleep I put my hands on my heat
  As soon as I start dreaming I''m right back on the street
  Any nigga in this game flowing they think they can see me
  Gotta be, fucked up in the head and smoking hemee
  Believe me if you thought like me you could be me
  But you ain''t been through what I been through and this shit ain''t that eas

  Now what New York niggas know about country grammar

  Or win a trip to ICU, and you can take yourself
  If you lucky motherfucker, I''m solider I told ya
  Push ya shit back, put my knife through ya six pack
  Gat bust, adrenaline rush, blowin'' the dust

 Duck nigga, everdays war
 I''m heavy on sports, to my draw like NBA''s store
 Don''t make me send the piece at you
 I''ll have your man walk around with another rest in peace tattoo
 Look creampuff, you can get killed here
 Nigga you ain''t invincible, even Superman in a wheel chair
 I''ve always been a picky man, but I ain''t a flowered star
 So I''mma fuck all fifty fans
 Look, whether you like it or not, right in ya spot
 All in your grill, wearin'' the crown, airin'' em down
 We''re in the pound puttin'' fare in the clown

 Your records can''t sell, your company is buyin'' em
 Give it up, Burger King is hirin''
 You shoulda been a cop, cause you snitch a lot
 Talkin'' to the jakes, you bound to get shot
 I used to watch Big Bird and Scooby Doo
 Now I''m choppin'' big birds and them bundles too
 For that Master P money, that shoppin'' spree money
 That coke, that dope and that ecstasy money
 I''m tryin'' to build empires across the state line
 So move like vampires, never see me in the daytime
 I jump out with a nina and a mack
 I have you like Khia, my neck, my back

 [Verse One]
 50 Cent I''m makin hits now
 Don''t try an act like you ain''t heard I''m the shit now
 Some bitches changed, cause they know I''m fittin to blow
 You should see how they react when I come through the door
 In the club my niggaz, we fittin to ball out
 Drink till we fall out
 Some shit jump off, nigga we goin all out
 Shots big enough to tear the fuckin wall out
 I''ll have your punk ass on the dance floor tryin to crawl out
 I had bad luck, then my luck changed up
 You see the Range, you see the rims all blinged up
 You ain''t hear what I charge for 16, I''m makin a killin
 These other rap niggaz just catching feelings
  (Chorus)
  Haha, yeah
  Yeah that''s it nigga, what the fuck you thought

THAT AIN''T GANGSTA
Verse 1:
  How you gonna take this? like a Man or a bitch?
  you gon'' get it on nigga or you gon'' snitch?
  I represent niggas in the hood gettin'' rich
  man, I stack chips and I unload clips
  after 3 Summers in the joint I thought life was hard
  some niggas started fightin'', some niggas found God
  you know me, started sellin'' leek in the yard
  yo, I ran into niggas who used to have Hummers
  big as Hell in the joint wearin'' ''86 numbers
  damm Dog, you been in here that long?
  you could think that, but say that and yo'' ass is dead wrong
  a convo is only three words, &quot;yo whattup&quot;
  you ain''t gotta work out to leave this bitch cut up
  let a nigga find out you on some goin'' home shit
  and you tryin'' to bounce without payin'' a loan, shit
  some niggas beat cases on the strength of they cream
  after the witnesses disappeared on the strength of they team
  I''m hard as Hell to get along wit'' so it never fails
  a nigga I got beef with end up in the same jail
  he had a L rolled in bible paper blowin'' the lye
  I sent him a little kite just to be blowin'' his high
  and when I shot you in NewYork why would I box you now?
  If I catch you in the yard I''m''a ox you down
  niggas you think is real really can''t hold they own
  I''ll have ''em on some E.T. shit tryin'' to phone home
  in here a gemstar is like a Nine Milly chrome
  it''s similar, infact they''ll both split ya dome
  scars are souvenirs, niggas always take ''em home.
  Chorus
  You got blown over the jack? (that ain''t gangsta)
  Your Man ran when you got clapped? (that ain''t gangsta)
  rockin'' a vest with no gat? (that ain''t gangsta)
  you only a thug when you rap? (that ain''t gangsta)
  niggas jooked you for your track? (that ain''t gangsta)
  you ran to other thugs to get it back? (that ain''t gangsta)
  niggas ran off with your packs? (that ain''t gangsta)
  If you ain''t bustin'' ya gat (that ain''t gangsta)
  Verse 2:
  You''d call me an Animal if you seen me livin'' on lock
  I stay in a box cats be shook when I''m visitin'' pop ulation
  when I walk by, niggas like &quot;Fifty don''t play Son&quot;
  &quot;yeah, somethin'' really wrong with that nigga...&quot;
  max out, I''m goin'' straight for the glock
  bust a u turn, I''m goin'' straight to the block
  the things that''ll happen if niggas say I can''t eat
  down goes the window....out goes the heat
  I''ll make the whole block look like a fuckin'' trackmeet
  some get it in the leg, some get it in the back
  some get it in the foot, bleed all over their airmax
  nigga pump my packs or pay poor tax
  it''s extortion, it happens in the hood often
  claim more lives than choices, free abortions
  Rich Nice says I got a problem with the dice
  ''cause I put the title to the Benz on the line twice
  I rock shit ''cause I stay on that block shit
  that 9mm Ruger to your knot shit
  see the difference is I''m real and you not, kid
  I still stash crack money in my sock, shit
  ya''ll niggas wanna pop shit? I pop clips
  leave with your blood on my mink in the drop Six
  Guiliani and Pataki can''t stop this
  since ''86 my whole clique pop Criss.

  Right now my life movin to fast to stop and pray
  See every now and then I smile just not today
  In my hood they let the choppers spray
  Somebody probably got shot today
  I named em pop when niggas surfboard
  You aint stoppin me dawg
  Only time you left ya hood is on Monopoly boards
  You grimey as birds shittin on the top of ya fords
  You will, die by the gun if you aint droppin ya sword
  I got tattoos as well as lead marks
  To me fucking is kinda like racin and I always get a head start
  My opinion of a sweet dream is a dead NARC
  Just yesterday guns is blastin with red darts
  Beef, you a target
  Cause when we come at yo ass, Aladdin wont be the only one the carpet
  Man you wanna play wit a ringer?
I aint a peoples person
I''ll give my next door neighbor the finger (fuck you)
Even though I got the shit in the stores
I''m like a nigga that borrow clothes
Bitch, I''m tryin to get in ya draws
Man I''ll dump a whole clip in ya mans braids
Pussys love Nelly, he made it look cool to wear bandaids
I''m blowin on damn haze
All of a sudden I''m gased, cause I''m on the radio and I can''t wait
If you aint up on thangs
Lloyd Banks is the name, G Units the game
Now I know to keep low when the heat blow
I''ll have niggas post up on ya block like I''m shootin the free throw
Still get the green from P dro, better known as Pedro
I''m ghetto like a patty ya egg roll
Yea they feinin to stick me, they don''t know the meanings is wit me
Snuck in wit Christina and Brittney
You only spend time at the mall
On New Years eve a body drops around the same time as the ball (yea)

Keep thinkin I''m candy
Aint nuttin sweet about me
Nigaas talkin in the pens and in the street about me
Some jake, tryin to watch every move I make
Cause my Deez''ll make fiends do the up town shake
I''m a pro, far from a amateur, holdin more keys than your fuckin janitor
They say &quot;God bless the child that could hold his own&quot;
You pay cops to hold you down, I just hold the chrome
Every breath I take, every step I take, every move I make
I got a ruger on my hip
You aint gotta like or love me but you gone respect me
You need a fifth and 2 clips to try and check me
12 in the afternoon we can start the clappin
Look homie I''m down for that day time action
Keep thinkin it''s a game time in front of ya home
Get the drop on that ass and shot shadder ya bones (yea)

When hoes see the new toy, they jump for joy
And even though the kid rappin

My guns under my pillow, I sleep wit my shoes on
Every single night me and my mack get our groove on
Don''t get moved on
Cause I shoot through your bicepts your tricepts
  Then breeze through ya projects
  When the coke come back
  It''s the China White
  And the d don''t sweat us in a bag a rice
  Let''s ride O T

  Since Yayo be a fearless man
  I donate my heart to them niggas that ran
  And, those niggas in the hood don''t wanna see me famous
  They rather see my moms make funeral arangements
  I got enough rhymes, to fill 6 notebooks
  I been spittin that shit ever since coke crushed
  You can hear me on your T.V. and radio at the same time
  I never ever say the same rhyme, it''s Tony 2 times
  Beware of my wraith, I''m gone school you niggas

  Yo, you know what I want? I want the beat to drop right..now
  niggas be thinkin'' I''m crazy right?
  you are crazy..
  I ain''t crazy...
  you are crazy....
  atleast I don''t think I''m crazy
  I think my shit is hot, I think I''m hot
  you hot but you crazy..
  why they wanna?..man..I don''t know...
  [Verse 1]
  It''s the money that makes shit get ugly
  It''s the money that makes these hoes love me
  It''s the money that makes niggas wanna slug me
  man..I thought the money would make it all lovely
  Yo, I actually write what I do or see
  the felonies from day to day make me say what I say
  when I die my art will be worth more than Picasso''s
  Don''t cry for me, smile for me
  and if you see them niggas that wet me, wile'' for me
  remember the good times, the chips we stacked
  the clips we packed
  and all the bricks we cooked from coke to crack
  let my tombstone read &quot;I Tried&quot; and from the start
  everything I wrote was from my heart
  so it''ll always be number one on my chart
  I get sensitive with my shit, don''t fuck with my art
  sometimes it sounds like I''m playin'' but I''m sayin''
  this shit is real, it ain''t a game.
  [Chorus repeat 2X]
  They say the good die young
  I guess these grimy niggas live a long time
  Sit in fancy whips, sip champaigne and shine
  Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine
  [Verse 2]
  First it happened to Stretch then to Pac and Big
  I''m convinced it can happen to anybody kid
  so I get vest up when I get dressed up
  in the hood it''s messed up, niggas runnin'' ''round shootin'' shit up
  if it''s Dom that you drinkin'' fill up my cup
  if you got somethin'' to doubt me, shut the fuck up
  why do niggas act like they hard when they know they butt?

Hustle hard for cash so I can spoil that ass
It''s like she loves me, she loves me not
Cause her friends pump her head hull of bullshit alot
I gave jewels I imported for her
Chanel bags I bought from boosters
To the hood I introduced her
She feisty and sometimes she wanna fight me
People saying if I get knocked she ain''t gon write me
The sick part is all that bullshit excites me

Yo when shorty say she hate me
You know she mean she love me
When she play me close at the bar
That mean she want some Bubbly
See my polying with another chick and shit get ugly
She wanna flip threaten to run keys across my whip
Try to burn a nigga with some Hominy Briss
That''s how she on it
When I met her she was lowkey
Now she wanna OD

Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls grips it quick
And kicks it quick, you know how black niggas get

Smokin weed, flippin ki''s, makin crazy G''s
Hittin'' buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue, take my loot, and I''m baggin you
Pimpin hoes that drive Volvo''s and Rodeos
Flash the Roll, make her wet, in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin back out

  I''m gettin'' what you get for a brick to talk greasy
 By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
 If you play me close, for sure I''m gonna pop my heat
 Niggas sayin they gon merk 50 how?
 We ridin ''round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow
 What you know about AK''s and AR 15''s?
 Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and inf beams, huh
 [Chorus 2X]

WANKSTA (REMIX)
[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
  Yeah.. it''s a problem, Flipmode nigga
  We on the highest temperature level of the fucking pressure cooker
  Blowing niggas tops, what?
  Flipmode up in this bitch, The Rulership Movement nigga
  Check it, let me talk, check it, check it
 [Busta Rhymes]
 There''s only one God sonny, and there ain''t no replacement
 And anybody thinkin different jus get locked in the basement
 You know we had to touch the beat cuz the track is dope, nigga
 And throw some bullet''s at you the size of cantaloupes, nigga
 A lotta niggas rollin around like they can''t get touched
 Even the pope know to stay in bullet proof Benz trucks
 Flipmode up in this bitch, ya niggas know we on fire
 We hang niggas like old sneakers from telephone wires
 [Rampage]
 Puerto Rican mami''s call me Papi
 Cuz they see me in the hood, poppin wheelies on my Kawasaki
 Yo they can''t stop me, Ramp yo, I''m kinda cocky
 I''ll break your fucking ribs like I''m playing ice hockey
 Bigger than life, extort the game, critically acclaimed
 Smack you in your face with my chain
 Now I''m ready to go to war like Saddam Hussein
 Everybody in the industry know my squad''s name
 [Chorus 1: Busta Rhymes]
 Yo we jus an idiot, and we here to merge somethin
 You know what chu dealing with, you know we here to hurt somethin
 So stop with the stupid shit, cuz it ain''t even worth frontin
 Hope you know that you could really end up in the earth cuzin
 [50 Cent]
 We do this all the time, right now we on the grind
 So hurry up and cop and go selling nicks and dimes
 Shorty she''s so fine, I gotta make her mine
 A ass like dat gotta be one of a kind
 I crush ''em every time, punch ''em with every line
 I''m fuckin with they mind, I make ''em press rewind
 They know they can''t shine if I''m around the rhyme
 Been on parole since ninety four cuz I commit the crime
 I say you on my line, I did it three ta nine
 If D''s ran up in my crib, you know who droppin dimes
 [Chorus 2: 50 Cent]
 You say you a gangsta but you neva pop nuttin
 We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin
  You go to the dealership but you neva cop nuttin
  You been hustlin a long time and you ain''t got nuttin
  [Baby Sham]
  I know your man, he says that you the bitch stuntin
  You don''t know how the gun cock to reach somethin
  Yeah, I see ya face in ya grill
  But it''s your conscience itchin to tell you the squad love a mil
  Like a forest field, we hunt ta god, it''s surreal
  Flipmode, cop boy, get your weight up for real, get at ''em
  [Chorus 1]
  [Chorus 2]
  [50 Cent]
  Damn homie, in highskewl you was the man, homie
  What the fuck happened to you?

  Now shorty think I''ma sweat her, sippin on amoretta
  I''m hit once than deada, I know I can do betta
  She look good but I know she after my chedda

  What up,   Blood? (What)
  What up,   Gangstaaa?
  [Verse 1]
  They say I walk around like got an &quot;S&quot; on my chest
  Naw, that''s a semi auto, and a vest on my chest
  I try not to say nothing, the DA might want to play in court
  But I''ll hunt or duck a nigga down like it''s sport
  Front on me, I''ll cut ya, gun butt ya or bump ya
  You getting money? I can''t none with ya then fuck ya
  I''m not the type to get knocked for D.W.I.
  I''m the type that''ll kill your connect when the coke price rise
  Gangstas, they bump my shit then they know me
  I grew up around some niggas that''s not my homies
  Hundred G''s I stash it (what), the mack I blast it (yeah)
  D''s come we dump the diesel and battery acid
  This flow''s been mastered, the ice I flash it
  Chokes me, I''ll have your mama picking out your casket, bastard
  I''m on the next level, right lane forget bezzle
  Benz pedal to the metal, hotter than a tea kettle, god (what)
  [Chorus] (1st time w/o first &quot;What up, Blood?&quot;) (2x)
  [Bridge]
  We don''t   play   that
  We don''t   play   that
  We don''t   play   that (G Unit)
  We don''t   play   around
  [Verse 2]
  I sit back, twist the best bud, burn and wonder
  When gangstas bump my shit, can they hear my hunger?
  When the 5th kick, duck quick, it sounds like thunder
  In December I''ll make your block feel like summer
  The rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine
  Every chick I fuck with is a dime
  I''m like Patty LaBelle, homie, I''m on my own
  Where I lay my hat is my home, I''m a rolling stone
  Cross my path I''ll crush ya, thinking I won''t touch ya
  I''ll have your ass using a wheelchair, cane, or crutches
  Industry hoe fuckers, in the hood they love us
  Stomp a bone out your ass with some brand new chuckas
  [Chorus] (2x)
  [Bridge] (4x)

WHO U REP WITH
[Verse 1 Nas]
  Hats off, to da rich ones who flash and floss
  Pour some liquors out to my dogs trapped up north
  Reminisce on the deceased who no longer exist
  Only wishin'' we could bring them back with songs like dis
  Old flicks on us chillin'' wit da old time click
  Holdin'' nines, thoughts of death, not our lives we risk
  How it use to be, early morn, pumpin'' in shifts
  Jakes wit pale faces in the night is the scariest
  They handcuff me, they knew my government and alias
  Various calls were made up for awarin'' us
  The D''s in the marked vans and cabs
  In our land, hoodrats get stapped by niggas who forty
  Turnin'' out young lady''s and make them make thoughties
  Got them coked out, the hood is bugged out
  Thug babies, famous in they strollers
  Before they walk they knew the hood talk
  It''s in the air of New York
  So everybody''ll pick em up, kissin em up
  Treatin'' them like they own, in dis hood we call home
  Fist fight till we grown and these guns come out
  Circle of life, it''s kinda deep how we end out.
